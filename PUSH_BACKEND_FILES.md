# 📤 Push Backend Package Files to GitHub

## ✅ Files Ready to Push

I've added `backend/package.json` and `backend/package-lock.json` to your local repository. They need to be pushed to GitHub.

## 🚀 Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Manual Push

```bash
git push origin main
```

If you get an error about branch protection, you may need to:
- Push from a different branch and create a PR
- Or disable branch protection temporarily
- Or use GitHub web interface

### Option 2: GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to: https://github.com/santoshKumar-T/Education-Learning-Copilot
2. Click **"Upload files"**
3. Navigate to `backend/` folder
4. Upload `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
5. Commit directly to `main` branch

---

## ✅ Verify Files Are in GitHub

After pushing, verify:
1. Go to: https://github.com/santoshKumar-T/Education-Learning-Copilot/tree/main/backend
2. Check if `package.json` exists
3. Check if `package-lock.json` exists

---

## 🔄 After Pushing

Once files are in GitHub:
1. Railway will auto-redeploy
2. Or manually redeploy in Railway
3. Build should work now!

**The backend package files are committed locally - just need to push them to GitHub!**
